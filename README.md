# rust-tcp-chat-canister

Purpose: TCP Chat Application with Canister.
Plan is transfer messages with tcp protocol and store messages in chain.

Because of short time, I just did echo server, it's not a fully functional version as you might know. But it's pretty easy to make it interactive chat, because network is already working and we've already done implementation of ICP.

There are bugs as you can understand.
There are comments in code if you want to learn little more.
